# LLM based AEB/ACC critical scenario generator 

This tool leverages Large Language models (LLMs) to create and simulate Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) and Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) scenarios in a low-fidelity 2D environment. Features include:

1. **Create Scenarios in Natural Language**: Describe a scenario in plain English (ex: ego vehicle is traveling at 100 kph towards a slower moving target vehicle traveling at 40 kph, target vehicle decelerates at -4 m/s^2 when when the gap is 20m) and the LLM transforms it into a simulation-ready configuration using multishot prompting.

3. **Visualize AEB & ACC Performance**: This tool uses CARLO (CARLA Low-budget), a lightweight and effective 2D simulator to test autonomous vehicle safety systems without the computational overhead of full 3D environments. See citation for CARLO below. CARLO renders AEB and ACC systems performance in real-time with:
   - Live speed and distance measurements
   - Real-time Forward Collision Warning (FCW) alerts
   - Real-time position and location updates

4. **Analyze Performance**: Evaluate system behavior through:
   - Time-to-collision (TTC)
   - Ego vs Target Speed
   - Distance to target
   - AEB/FCW activation points
   - Required vs commanded deceleration data

5. **Explore Critical Scenarios** - (WIP) more info on this in the next section
   1. Optimizes the allocation of simulation resources through the use of probablistic models 
   2. Maximize test coverage by exploring the entire parameter space with adaptive sampling techniques
   3. Identifies the most critical scenarios by targeting the 'unknown regions' - boundaries of pass/fail within the parameter space

Note: the API key is free and is rate limited.

# Critical Scenario Generation and exploration using probabilistic models (WIP)

**LHS_filter.py**

1. Determine the most salient parameters in a scene and reasonable ranges.
2. Initial sampling of the parameter space using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)
3. Filtering out the unrealistic/non-critical scenarios presim, then batch simulate the scenarios
4. Filter out the scenarios with a high probability of collision or avoidance (not useful for the training stage)

**probabilistic_model.py**

5. Train the initial Gaussian Process model using the simulation results
6. Use LHS & criticality filtering to filter to generate another set of scenario configurations
7. Predict collision probabilities (likelihood of a collision occurring in a given scenario) using GP model and calculate the uncertainty scores (modelâ€™s confidence in its probability prediction) 
8. Filter scenarios configs with a collision probability of 0.4-0.6 (borderline scenarios that are neither clear passes nor clear fails) 
9. Borderline scenarios with high uncertainty: these scenarios lie near the pass/fail boundary, and the model is unsure of their outcome (perhaps due to lack of training data). The results would be good to feed back into the dataset for retraining the model. 
10. Borderline Scenarios with Low Uncertainty: these scenarios are also on the pass/fail boundary, but the model is quite confident in its prediction. These would be good for evaluating the model, and would be critical scenarios to test the system.
11. Train the model until the model predictions are stabilized (uncertainty, collision probability, clear decision boundary)
12. The model is ready to use to create a test set of 'critical' scenarios to test the system.

Example output of ego vs target speed in the AEB example (Red - low probability of collision, blue - high probability of collision). This makes sense intuitively as most AEB systems can scrub a maximum of 45-60 kph.

# Future Development
I'd like to continue to explore applications of LLMs and probabilistic models in AD/ADAS V&V. Here are a few areas that I am interested in:
- Developing a GUI that allows test engineers to systematically and visually explore a scenario design space, for example, highway merge [highway_gui.py]
- LLM generates the roadgraph and agents using the user selections from the GUI 
- Scenario reconstruction of accident/crash reports using LLMs 
- Testing the probabilistic scenario generation framework on other scenes (ex: unprotected left turn, target cut-in, highway merge)
- Automating triage/categorization test failures using LLMs

## Dependencies
