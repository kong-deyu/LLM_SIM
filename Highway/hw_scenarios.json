    "1. Merging and Exiting Scenarios": {
      "1.1 Merging onto the Freeway": [
        {
            "Scenario": "High-Density Traffic Merge",
            "Description": "The autonomous vehicle (AV) approaches the freeway on-ramp during peak rush hour. The on-ramp is a single-lane, uphill incline leading to a short acceleration lane due to urban infrastructure constraints. The freeway traffic is flowing at high speeds with minimal spacing between vehicles, offering few suitable gaps for merging. Vehicles in the rightmost lane of the freeway are traveling close together, with drivers reluctant to adjust speed or change lanes to accommodate merging traffic. The AV must accurately assess the speed and distance of oncoming vehicles, adjust its acceleration appropriately, and execute a safe merge maneuver without causing disruption to the flow of traffic or compromising safety."
          },
          {
            "Scenario": "Uncooperative Drivers",
            "Description": "While attempting to merge onto the freeway, the AV encounters drivers in the adjacent lane who are unresponsive to its merging signals. Despite using turn indicators and positioning itself for a merge, nearby vehicles maintain their speed or even accelerate to prevent the AV from entering the lane. The traffic conditions are moderate, but driver behavior is aggressive. The AV must navigate this challenging social driving situation by finding an appropriate gap, potentially adjusting its merging strategy, such as slowing down to merge behind or accelerating to merge ahead, all while ensuring safety and compliance with traffic laws."
          },
          {
            "Scenario": "Abrupt Stops on On-Ramp",
            "Description": "As the AV proceeds onto the on-ramp leading to the freeway, the vehicle directly ahead abruptly comes to a complete stop, possibly due to mechanical issues or sudden obstruction. The on-ramp is a single-lane with no shoulder or safe area to maneuver around the stopped vehicle. Traffic behind the AV is also entering the on-ramp, creating potential risk of rear-end collisions. The AV must quickly detect the unexpected stop, decelerate safely to avoid a collision, and determine the best course of action, which may include stopping and waiting, alerting following vehicles, or, if possible, safely navigating around the obstruction."
          },
          {
            "Scenario": "Acceleration Lane Ends Early",
            "Description": "The AV is merging onto a freeway where the acceleration lane is unusually short because of construction work that has temporarily reduced the length of the merge area. Warning signs indicate the lane ends earlier than normal. The AV must quickly adjust its speed to match that of the freeway traffic within a limited distance. If the traffic is heavy, finding a suitable gap becomes more challenging. The AV needs to decide whether to rapidly accelerate to merge ahead of an approaching vehicle or decelerate to merge behind, all while ensuring a smooth and safe entry onto the freeway without impeding other vehicles."
          },
          {
            "Scenario": "Malfunctioning Ramp Meters",
            "Description": "The AV approaches an on-ramp equipped with ramp metering traffic signals designed to regulate the flow of vehicles entering the freeway. On this occasion, the ramp meters are malfunctioning, displaying erratic signals or remaining unlit altogether. Some drivers are stopping at the non-functioning lights, while others proceed without stopping, causing unpredictable traffic behavior on the on-ramp. The AV must interpret the situation, decide whether to stop or proceed, and adjust its merging strategy accordingly, all while adhering to traffic laws and ensuring safety."
          },
          {
            "Scenario": "Multiple Vehicles Merging Simultaneously",
            "Description": "The AV is on an on-ramp that converges with another on-ramp from a different road, both leading onto the same acceleration lane. Several vehicles from both ramps are attempting to merge onto the freeway simultaneously, creating a convergence point with potential for side-by-side merging conflicts. The acceleration lane is of standard length but is congested due to the volume of merging traffic. The AV must navigate this complex scenario by anticipating the actions of adjacent merging vehicles, adjusting its speed and position to safely merge onto the freeway without causing collisions or impeding traffic flow."
          },
          {
            "Scenario": "On-Ramp Closure or Blockage",
            "Description": "Upon approaching its planned on-ramp to enter the freeway, the AV encounters unexpected closure signs due to construction, an accident, or other obstructions completely blocking the entrance. There are no prior warnings or suggested detours provided. The AV must quickly update its route, identifying an alternative on-ramp or route to reach its destination. This requires recalculating the navigation path, considering traffic conditions, and ensuring compliance with traffic laws while executing the rerouting maneuver, which may involve complex urban driving."
          },
          {
            "Scenario": "Slow-Moving Vehicles on On-Ramp",
            "Description": "While entering the on-ramp, the AV is behind one or more slow-moving vehicles, such as heavy trucks or vehicles towing trailers, which are accelerating at a significantly lower rate than typical traffic. The on-ramp and acceleration lane are single-lane with no opportunity to overtake safely before merging onto the freeway. The freeway traffic is moving at high speeds, and the slow pace of the vehicles ahead affects the AV's ability to match the speed of freeway traffic for a smooth merge. The AV must adjust its merging strategy, possibly by increasing following distance, preparing for a longer acceleration period, and finding a safe gap to merge without causing disruption."
          },
          {
            "Scenario": "Wrong-Way Entry onto Freeway",
            "Description": "The AV is preparing to merge onto the freeway when its sensors detect an oncoming vehicle traveling the wrong way, entering the freeway via the off-ramp and heading directly towards exiting traffic. This unexpected and hazardous situation requires immediate action. The AV must quickly assess the safest response, which may include stopping safely, alerting other drivers via signals or horn, and potentially contacting emergency services. The AV must also adjust its own merging plan to avoid the wrong-way vehicle and ensure the safety of its passengers and other road users."
          },
          {
            "Scenario": "High-Speed Traffic on Merge Lane",
            "Description": "The AV is in the acceleration lane, preparing to merge onto the freeway, when it encounters vehicles behind it using the merge lane as an extension of the freeway's rightmost lane. These vehicles are traveling at high speeds, overtaking other vehicles in the merge lane, and potentially cutting off merging traffic. The AV must navigate this misuse of the merge lane, which increases the risk of side-swipe collisions and reduces the space and time available for a safe merge. The AV needs to monitor fast-approaching vehicles from behind, adjust its speed accordingly, and find a safe gap in freeway traffic while being cautious of vehicles improperly using the merge lane."
